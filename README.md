### Step 2, clone the repo choosing your version
After that, go to the directory where you want DOOM to be installed and open the command prompt. Once opened, execute:
`git lfs clone https://github.com/Zoult/old-DOOM.git GZDoom4.7.1Win32` for the GZDoom 32 bit version;
`git lfs clone https://github.com/Zoult/old-DOOM.git GZDoom4.7.1Win64` for the GZDoom 64 bit version;
`git lfs clone https://github.com/Zoult/old-DOOM.git DOSBox` for the DOSBox version.

### Step 2.1 Playing the GZDoom Version
