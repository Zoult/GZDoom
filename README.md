## Important Disclaimer
I created this repository for private use, i turned it public to let others play DOOM. In this repo, i'm the owner of nothing, it's just a collection of 
forked projects. My intent is not to take ownership of anything.

## Setup

### Step 1.1, check if Git is installed
Having large files, this repo has Git LFS, and this requires Git. You can check if is installed by running `git --version` in the command prompt. If you don't have it installed yet, download and install it [from here](https://git-scm.com/download/ "Download Git").

### Step 1.2, install Git LFS
Now download Git LFS [from here](https://git-lfs.github.com/ "Download Git LFS") and install it.

### Step 2, clone the repo
After that, go to the directory where you want DOOM to be installed and open the command prompt; Once opened, execute `git lfs clone https://github.com/Zoult/old-DOOM.git`

### Step 3, Choose you version
Finally you just have to choose the version you want to play: GZDoom for Windows 32 bit, 64 bit or the DOSBox version.

#### GZDoom Version
To play the GZDoom version, you just have to execute **gzdoom.exe**, and a menu with all DOOM editions will appear, choose one of it and play.

#### DOSBox Version
Instead, for the DOSBox version, you got to open DOOM.EXE with DOSBox, simply drag and drop on the DOSBox link if you have it on your Desktop.
